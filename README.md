# Welcome to my Software projects! 
## What does this app do? 
It's supposed to be that one part of my website that displays software projects. 

## How does this app work? What makes it different from the other pages in your *awesome* website?
The 'software projects' webpage is similar to the 'web projects' webpage in that all content here is DYNAMICALLY loaded. The difference here is that this one uses React. React is very different from Jade/Pug and plain Javascript/JQuery in that it uses JSX, and the way it templates/renders is different as well. While Pug writes HTML in a different way and adds functionality, React uses Javascript/JSX to create Components, and then renders it onto a page. At least I think that's how it works. I'm kind of stupid so I could be wrong. I did my best. Gold star. 

## Hey... why is this part so special that it deserves its own git repository? 
Because the code in its final build form is different. 
I'm using React and JSX, so I need to compile my code into plain old javascript/html before putting it on my site. 

## Why React? 
Because although HandlebarsJS and Jade/Pug are nice templating systems, they don't have much functionality past templating and making HTML slightly nicer, and they're a bit funky to use. 

## I see, that's interesting. 
Glad you think so.

## So... how are you doing today? 
I'm doing well, thanks. Wait, since when did this turn into a weird conversation I'm having with myself? 

I should eat dinner.

# Welcome to my Software projects! 
## What does this app do? 
It's supposed to be that one part of my website that displays software projects. 

## Hey... why is this part so special that it deserves its own git repository? 
Because the code in its final build form is different. 
Here I'm using React and JSX, so I need to compile my code into plain old javascript/html before putting it on my site. 

## Why React? 
Because although HandlebarsJS and Jade/Pug are nice templating systems, they don't have much functionality past templating and making HTML slightly nicer, and they're a bit funky to use. 

## I see, that's interesting. 
Glad you think so.

## So... how are you doing today? 
I'm doing well, thanks. Wait, since when did this turn into a weird conversation I'm having with myself? 

## I'm not sure. You're kinda weird. 
I'm not weird! You're weird! 

## At least I can admit it. Or at least my half of you? Wait, what am I even supposed to be
I have no idea, I thought I was me? What??? If I'm me and you're not me then who are you

## I am me, you are you. 
But wait we're the same person! 

## Oh yeah. 
Uh huh. I think we milked this cow far enough. 

## Milked this cow far enough? What is this supposed to be, like a movie with too many sequels or something
OKAY JEEZ THE MEME IS STALE GET OVER YOURSELF

## Sorry. 
I should eat dinner.
